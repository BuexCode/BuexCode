BuexCode stands for not more and not less then Code for Escape Room Games (Wikipedia [DE](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Game) / [EN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_room)

Working on a real escape rooms and we started to work on options to use IT/IOT technologies to complement the classic puzzles with new and yet rarely used IT supported quests - basicly to support the crazy innovative ideas of the creative head, iniitiator and founder of the Escape Room Center to be established.

... long story ...

As more and more devices come into play and with gaining complexity we (I) found that classic old school versioning, release and rollout managment etc -all depending on single head knowledge- are requiring lot of effort and become a risky escape game itself.
We (I) decided to go the next step and ibtroduce git and guthub with moving from Arduino to more up to date programming environments liek VSCode at the same time.

We pulled a lot of knowledge and reference code from the community are willing to give something back, Actually anything has tobe kept private as publishing would mean talking ablout secrets --- the intimcy of the quests. Taking the chance to solve them within the game :-)

Giving something back the community is something we plan, most likely this will be guidance and snippets how we worked around issues using arduino/esp stuff stable and effectively.
